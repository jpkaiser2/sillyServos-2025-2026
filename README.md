<h1>About The Code</h1>
<p>The current code in this repository is the REV Robotics Starter Robot code. As of now, it does not need to be modified and works with the starter bots. However, once we build a custom bot or add on to the starter bot, the code will need to be modified or replaced with a fresh instance of the FTC SDK.</p>
